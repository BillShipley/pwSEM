using either the gam or the gamm functions of the mgcv package}

\item{MAG}{A matrix encoding the directed acyclic graph (DAG), or the mixed
acyclic graph, of the structural equations model.  This is created using
the DAG or the makeGM function in the gmm library}

\item{data}{A data frame holding the observed data used in the calls to
the models in the sem.model object}
}
\value{
